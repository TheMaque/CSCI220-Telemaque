COURSE NUMBER: CSCI220-01 Web Programming

Full Name: Reginald Telemaque

Major: Computer Science

Purpose: Final: Shopping Cart Application

Description: Build a basic Shopping Cart application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have provided a JSON file below with item data, including links to images. 
This assignment is primarily intended to demonstrate your ability to use JavaScript, but I want you to also use your HTML/CSS abilities to design an attractive and functional user experience. Think about shopping carts that you use online and consider adopting some of the design patterns / techniques you see there. But do not copy-paste from another site. I want to see your code and design.
