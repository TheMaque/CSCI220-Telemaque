However, his favorite music Hip-Hop/Rap, for this Reggie's all-time favorite artist is the late Juice WRLD. Juice Wrld was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1998 - he was raised by his single mother and she is described as a religious and conservative woman who didn't allow him to listen to hip hop.

    One of his songs, Legends, was dedicated to 20-year-old XXXTentacion and 21-year-old Lil Peep - who died in 2018 and 2017 - and contained the lyrics "all the legends seem to die out". <a href="https://tidal.com/magazine/article/juice-wrld-1998-2019/1-73572" style="color: rgb(170, 170, 170)">Read more about Juice WRLD here.</a> </p>
