     <h1>Jennifer's Experiment Details. ðŸ“ƒ</h1>   
     <h2>Description:</h2>
     <p>College students consume surprising quantities of caffeine on average. This study seeks to determine if a correlation exists between the amount of caffeine an individual consumes daily and that individual's grade point average in school.
        The initial experiment included a group, which received daily caffeine equal to the national average (Group A), a group which received twice the national daily average (Group B), and a control group which received a placebo (Group C). 
        Preliminary results indicate that average consumption of daily caffeine led to a slight and steady increase in GPA throughout the term. A higher than average consumption of caffeine led to higher GPA initially, but then grades fell off towards the end of the semester. Finally, no consumption of caffeine led to neither a significant increase or decrease in overall GPA performance.</p>

        <h2>Steps to Reproduce:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>100 students were selected from volunteer applicants between the ages of 18-22 years old, with equal numbers of female and male participants and with a starting GPA between 3.2 and 3.3. </li> 
            <li>Each student was assigned a number from 1-100.</li>
            <li>Numbers were then randomly selected and assigned to groups A, B, and C.</li>
            <li>Group A was given caffeine equivalent to 3 cups of coffee per day. (The National Average)</li>
            <li>Group B was given caffeine equivalent to 6 cups of coffee per day.</li>
            <li>Group C was given a placebo.</li>
            <li>Grade point averages were tracked throughout the term and averaged by group at the start of the semester, at midterm, and after final grades were submitted.</li>
        </ol>

            Here I make a table for data results.
