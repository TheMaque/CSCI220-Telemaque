COURSE NUMBER: CSCI220-01 Web Programming

Full Name: Reginald Telemaque

Major: Computer Science

Purpose: Jennifer is almost ready to present the initial findings of her experiment to investors.
Thanks to you she has a web page containing the information she wants to communicate. 
But, she knows that first impressions make a big difference, so she wants to make the information on her web page stand out. 
Help Jennifer make a good first impression by styling her web page with CSS to make it look more professional and provide a way for investors to get in touch with her

     <p> <img src="caffeine.jpg" alt ="Caffeine Molecule" style= "width: 250px" style="height: 200px" align="right"> College students consume surprising quantities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> on average. This study seeks to determine if a correlation exists between the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> an individual consumes daily and that individual's grade point average in school.
        The initial experiment included a group, which received daily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> equal to the national average (Group A), a group which received twice the national daily average (Group B), and a control group which received a placebo (Group C). 
        Preliminary results indicate that average consumption of daily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> led to a slight and steady increase in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education">GPA</a></a> 
        throughout the term. A higher than average consumption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> led to higher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education">GPA</a></a> initially, but then grades fell off towards the end of the semester. Finally, no consumption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> led to neither a significant increase or decrease in overall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education">GPA</a></a> performance.</p>

        <h2>Steps to Reproduce:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>100 students were selected from volunteer applicants between the ages of 18-22 years old, with equal numbers of female and male participants and with a starting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education">GPA</a></a> between 3.2 and 3.3. </li> 
            <li>Each student was assigned a number from 1-100.</li>
            <li>Numbers were then randomly selected and assigned to groups A, B, and C.</li>
            <li>Group A was given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> equivalent to 3 cups of coffee per day. (The National Average)</li>
            <li>Group B was given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> equivalent to 6 cups of coffee per day.</li>
            <li>Group C was given a placebo.</li>
            <li>Grade point averages were tracked throughout the term and averaged by group at the start of the semester, at midterm, and after final grades were submitted.</li>
        </ol>
